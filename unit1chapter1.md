Psychology word derive from the Greek, study of the soul, today it is commonly referred as an academic discipline whose subject of study is human behavior and the process of the mind. The process of mind was seen by Ernest Hilgard as Cognition (knowledge and beliefs), Emotion (Affect, Moods, Feelings) and Motivation (Drives, Goals, Purposes, Needs, Desires)

Psychology is seen as a hub science where all disciplines like social sciences, philosophy, natural sciences, health care, medicine, art and humanities are linked together. Because it is difficult to close the borders of the psychology field, there is a large variety of opinions whereas Psychology is a science or not. (example, reduction of psychology as a biological science only is a common opinion.)

Psychology explore a broad range of concepts such as perception, development, cognition, attention, emotion, intelligence, phenomenology, motivation, brain functioning, personality, behavior, and interpersonal relationships, the mental health, the unconscious mind and spirituality.

For this reason, the study of psychology approach each of these subjects separately as self-contained domain of study and as we will see later lead to specialized sub-field of the discipline. For example, the approach of care, counseling, clinical, psychiatry is an approach while the biological brain functions, the cognition is an other.

And because it is a broad discipline that can't be reduced to one of it's part, it important to consider the different levels of explanation : psychological (mind processes, cognition, emotion, motivation), sociocultural (social and cultural structures, practices and environments) and biophysical (neurotransmitters, genes, hormones)

An other subject of psychology is consciousness and understanding it's nature raise many questions that are still very controversial today.
